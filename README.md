Repo for Assignment 6: Server-side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This is my current webage for my weather dashboard using openweathermap api.
I was able to generate the current forecast by searching for a city. Then at the same time I generate a 5 day forecast over the next 5 days to show what the weather will be like in that city.
